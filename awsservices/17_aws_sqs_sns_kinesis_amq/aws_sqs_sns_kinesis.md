  - Work queues for batch processing
- **Features**
  - Standard and FIFO queues
  - Message retention (up to 14 days)
  - Dead-letter queues
- **Scalability**
  - Virtually unlimited throughput
  - Auto-scaling

## **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
- **Fully managed pub/sub messaging service**
- **Characteristics**
  - Push-based
  - One-to-many communication
- **Use Cases**

  - Application and system alerts
- **Features**
  - Topics and subscriptions
  - Multiple protocols (HTTP, email, SMS, etc.)
  - Message filtering
- **Scalability**
  - High throughput
  - Auto-scaling

## **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**
- **Real-time data streaming service**
- **Characteristics**
  - Ordered record delivery
  - Real-time processing
  - Durable storage
- **Use Cases**
  - Real-time analytics
  - Log and event data streaming
  - IoT data processing
- **Features**
  - Shards for parallel processing

  - Enhanced fan-out consumers
- **Scalability**
  - Handles terabytes of data per day
  - Manual scaling by adjusting shard count

## **Comparison**
- **Message Delivery**
  - SQS: Pull-based, queued
  - SNS: Push-based, immediate
  - Kinesis: Real-time streaming
- **Data Retention**
  - SQS: Up to 14 days
  - SNS: No persistence (immediate delivery)
  - Kinesis: Up to 365 days
- **Throughput**
  - SQS: Virtually unlimited
  - SNS: High throughput
  - Kinesis: Based on shard capacity
- **Use Case Focus**
  - SQS: Decoupling and asynchronous processing
  - SNS: Broadcasting and notifications
  - Kinesis: Real-time data analytics and processing

## **Integration Capabilities**
- **All three services integrate well with various AWS services**
- **Can be used together for complex architectures**
  - Example: Kinesis to process streams, SNS to notify, SQS to queue for further processing
